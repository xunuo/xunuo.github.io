'Deadly' dog to walk free?

"- I know."

"By BEN DICKINSON".

"- I know."

A vicious rottweiler that badly mauled a "Shenton Park" woman, will be allowed to remain at its house in Cambridge, and could walk in public, while Claremont council decides what action to take.

"- I know."

Cambridge would not clarify if the dog needed to be locked up.

"- I know."

The 62-year-old university professor required emergency surgery, after receiving severe injuries to her head and arm, during the unprovoked attack at a dog exercise area at "Lake Claremont" last Friday.

"- I know."

The dog bit the woman's arm to the bone, then dragged her by the head, as neighbours responding to her screams tried to pull the animal off her.

"- I know."

"If it had been a kid, they wouldn't have survived," she said after spending two days in "Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital".

"- I know."

She called for the dog to be euthanised, but "Claremont CEO Liz Ledger" would not say if the council would seek a destruction order.

"- I know."

The victim, who asked not to be identified, said she was walking her dog with her partner at the "Lakeway Street" off-leash exercise area shortly before 9am on January 24.

"- I know."

She was approached by the "very large" rottweiler that was "walking around on its own".

"- I know."

"It came up to me and it started to be a bit menacing for absolutely no reason," she said, "My dog wasn't even near me, it was near my partner."

"- I know."

She said she tried to walk away from the rottweiler, but it followed her and became increasingly aggressive.

"- I know."

"It was definitely intent on attacking me," she said.

"- I know."

She shouted desperately to other walkers to try to identify the rottweiler's owner, before the dog jumped on her back, tore her clothes and bit her shoulder.

"- I know."

"Once it had me down on the ground it bit my arm straight down to the bone," she said.

"- I know."

People from nearby houses came running at the sound of her screams.

"- I know."

By the time they reached her, the dog had bitten into her scalp and was dragging her across the grass by her head.

"- I know."

"They kicked and punched the dog to get it off me," she said, "I was bleeding quite badly."

"- I know."

She said the dog's owner walked away during the brutal attack, but was confronted by witnesses who demanded her identification.

"- I know."

"She didn't intervene, she didn't shout at the dog," the victim said.

"- I know."

An ambulance took the injured woman to "Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital", where a surgeon stitched her head and arm and administered an antibiotic drip.

"- I know."

She spent two nights in hospital before being discharged on Sunday.

"- I know."

She said she suffered a panic attack on her first night at home and could not sleep.

"- I know."

"I can't lie down because all the stitches are in the back of my head," she said.

"- I know."

"I can't move my arm [so] I can't even look after myself."

"- I know."

While she said she was "lucky" to be alive, the attack has left her shaken.

"- I know."

"It's life changing," she said, "I won't be going to a dog park like that again."

"- I know."

"Ms Ledger" said the rottweiler's owner provided a written statement about the attack on Saturday, and met with the investigating community safety officer.

"- I know."

"All the relevant information will need to be collated and assessed, and the investigation finalised before the Town decides on the next course of action," she said.

"- I know."

Rangers would "at a minimum" issue an infringement notice, but may also start criminal proceedings in the magistrates court.

"- I know."

"That will be a collective decision made by the Town once the investigation has been finalised," she said.

"- I know."

A criminal conviction carries a maximum fine of $10,000.

"- I know."

"Ms Ledger" did not say whether the council would seek an order to have the dog euthanised.

"- I know."

She said Claremont had asked Cambridge rangers to check the dog's registration and make sure it was safely contained.

"- I know."

The victim urged the council to seek a destruction order.

"- I know."

"I'm a dog lover myself, but I'm worried the dog's going to do it again," she said.

"- I know."

"If it's a small fine and a slap of the wrist it's not exactly going to be something that they'd regret."

"- I know."

A four-year-old Nedlands girl was flown to "Perth Children"'s Hospital in mid-January, after being mauled by a rottweiler in shallow water at Quindalup beach near Dunsborough.

"- I know."

"It was the most horrendous thing you could imagine as a parent," the child's mother said ("Hero Luke" saved mauled Nedlands girl, POST, January 18).

"- I know."
