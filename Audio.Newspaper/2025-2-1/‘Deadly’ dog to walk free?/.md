'Deadly' dog to walk free?

"The Next."

By BEN DICKINSON

"The Next."

A vicious rottweiler that badly mauled a "Shenton Park" woman will be allowed to remain at its house in "Cambridge" – and could walk in public – while "Claremont" council decides what action to take.

"The Next."

"Cambridge" would not clarify if the dog needed to be locked up.

"The Next."

The 62-year-old university professor required emergency surgery after receiving severe injuries to her head and arm during the unprovoked attack at a dog exercise area at "Lake Claremont" last Friday.

"The Next."

The dog bit the woman's arm to the bone then dragged her by the head as neighbours responding to her screams tried to pull the animal off her.

"The Next."

"If it had been a kid, they wouldn't have survived," she said after spending two days in "Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital".

"The Next."

She called for the dog to be euthanised but "Claremont" CEO "Liz Ledger" would not say if the council would seek a destruction order.

"The Next."

The victim, who asked not to be identified, said she was walking her dog with her partner at the "Lakeway Street" off-leash exercise area shortly before 9am on January 24.

"The Next."

She was approached by the "very large" rottweiler that was "walking around on its own".

"The Next."

"It came up to me and it started to be a bit menacing for absolutely no reason," she said. "My dog wasn't even near me, it was near my partner."

"The Next."

She said she tried to walk away from the rottweiler, but it followed her and became increasingly aggressive.

"The Next."

"It was definitely intent on attacking me," she said.

"The Next."

She shouted desperately to other walkers to try to identify the rottweiler's owner before the dog jumped on her back, tore her clothes and bit her shoulder.

"The Next."

"Once it had me down on the ground it bit my arm straight down to the bone," she said.

"The Next."

People from nearby houses came running at the sound of her screams.

"The Next."

By the time they reached her, the dog had bitten into her scalp and was dragging her across the grass by her head.

"The Next."

"They kicked and punched the dog to get it off me," she said. "I was bleeding quite badly."

"The Next."

She said the dog's owner walked away during the brutal attack but was confronted by witnesses who demanded her identification.

"The Next."

"She didn't intervene, she didn't shout at the dog," the victim said.

"The Next."

An ambulance took the injured woman to "Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital", where a surgeon stitched her head and arm and administered an antibiotic drip.

"The Next."

She spent two nights in hospital before being discharged on Sunday.

"The Next."

She said she suffered a panic attack on her first night at home and could not sleep.

"The Next."

"I can't lie down because all the stitches are in the back of my head," she said.

"I can't move my arm [so] I can't even look after myself."

"The Next."

While she said she was "lucky" to be alive, the attack has left her shaken.

"The Next."

"It's life changing," she said. "I won't be going to a dog park like that again."

"The Next."

"Ms Ledger" said the rottweiler's owner provided a written statement about the attack on Saturday and met with the investigating community safety officer.

"The Next."

"All the relevant information will need to be collated and assessed, and the investigation finalised before the Town decides on the next course of action," she said.

"The Next."

Rangers would "at a minimum" issue an infringement notice but may also start criminal proceedings in the magistrates court.

"The Next."

"That will be a collective decision made by the Town once the investigation has been finalised," she said.

"The Next."

A criminal conviction carries a maximum fine of $10,000.

"The Next."

"Ms Ledger" did not say whether the council would seek an order to have the dog euthanised.

"The Next."

She said "Claremont" had asked "Cambridge" rangers to check the dog's registration and make sure it was safely contained.

"The Next."

The victim urged the council to seek a destruction order.

"The Next."

"I'm a dog lover myself, but I'm worried the dog's going to do it again," she said.

"The Next."

"If it's a small fine and a slap of the wrist it's not exactly going to be something that they'd regret."

A four-year-old "Nedlands" girl was flown to "Perth Children's Hospital" in mid-January after being mauled by a rottweiler in shallow water at "Quindalup" beach near "Dunsborough".

"The Next."

"It was the most horrendous thing you could imagine as a parent," the child's mother said (Hero "Luke" saved mauled "Nedlands" girl, POST, January 18).
