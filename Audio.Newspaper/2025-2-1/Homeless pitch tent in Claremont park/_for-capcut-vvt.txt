"- I know."

"- I know."

A couple who set up camp, in a central Claremont park, have highlighted what the mayor says is a growing number of rough sleepers and panhandlers in the town.

"- I know."

Locals and mayor "Jock Barker" say they are frustrated, there is little in the council’s power to resolve the issue.

"- I know."

The pair, who identified themselves to locals as Aboriginal people who had “the right” to camp where they wanted to, initially set up camp about a week ago, on "Public Transport Authority" land, near the corner of Gugeri and Langsford streets, near the "Claremont CBD".

"- I know."

A few days later, they moved across the road, into bushland in "Rowe Park".

"- I know."

Their setup included tarp, strung up across the trees, a two-person tent, and cooking equipment.

"- I know."

Town of Claremont staff responded to multiple complaints, about the camp on PTA land and in the park.

"- I know."

"On Wednesday", the pair packed up and moved on.

"- I know."

"Mayor Jock Barker" said there had been a recent increase in the Town, of people asking for money and, at times, being threatening.

"- I know."

“It’s not good enough, to have elderly and young people in the town being asked for money, near the ATM,” he said.

"- I know."

“I’ve spoken to a number of people about this happening to them, and they have felt terribly threatened.

"- I know."

“I’m concerned that there are these itinerants in the town, smoking cigarettes that cost about $50 a packet, and using iPhones, but then they’re begging for money.

"- I know."

“I’m worried that residents giving them money, encourages them to keep coming back.

"- I know."

“I saw a "Christ Church" boy give one of these people a banana, and they just threw it on the street.

"- I know."

“They don’t want food, they want your money, and what are they going to do with the money? Go buy more cigarettes.

"- I know."

“There’s definitely been an uptick, of people sleeping rough and asking for money, and why wouldn’t they?

"- I know."

“As long as it goes unchallenged by the council, they will continue to set up their camps here.

"- I know."

“I really think it’s time, that local government was given the wherewithal, to move these people on.

"- I know."

“I’m not being uncharitable, it’s just that they become a threat, or an apparent threat, such as at the bank early in the morning, or late at night.

"- I know."

"CEO Liz Ledger" said, the woman living at the first campsite told rangers she was experiencing homelessness, and she was given information on the options available, such as drop-in centres, and asked to move her camp.

"- I know."

“"On Wednesday", in response to further complaints, from members of the public, in relation to a new encampment, a community safety officer and the manager attended "Rowe Park".

"- I know."

“The same person was at the site, along with another person.

"- I know."

“"The Town"’s officers had a lengthy conversation with the couple, discussed possible options available to them, and directed them to vacate the area by 3 pm.

"- I know."

“If the camp is still there after that time, "W-A Police" will be contacted.

"- I know."

“There have been no reported incidents of antisocial behaviour, that the "Community Safety" team are aware of, to date.”

"- I know."

"In W-A", police and councils have limited powers, to move people on, unless they pose a threat.

"- I know."

It is not illegal, to beg or sleep in a public place.

"- I know."
