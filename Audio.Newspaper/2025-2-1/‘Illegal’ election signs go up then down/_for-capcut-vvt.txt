"- I hove."

Illegally placed election advertising signs have spread across verges and public land, as hopeful politicians gear up for the state election on March 8.

"- I hove."

Most of the signs were illegal until writs were issued on Wednesday, according to "Churchlands MLA Christine Tonkin".

"- I hove."

"I notice that other candidates are in breach of Town of Cambridge and City of Stirling policy in this regard," she said.
